# QA Practical SFIA Project 2
## Project Brief
For this project I was asked to make an application that used concepts from previous training modules that I have done through QA academy such as Software Development with Python, Continuous integration and Cloud Fundamentals.

The project brief had 2 main predefined rules that my final application had to meet, one was for how the application functions and the other was for how I architected my services.

### application functions
we had to limit the scope of our application to a random object genarator for example:
* A prize generator.
* D&D style character generator.
* Theme and setting generator for short stories

### application Architecture 
My applications architecture had to be micro-service orientated and with at least 4 services working together.
