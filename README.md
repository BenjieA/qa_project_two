# QA Practical SFIA Project 2
## Project Brief
For this project I was asked to make an application that used concepts from previous training modules that I have done through QA academy which included Software Development with Python, Continuous integration and Cloud Fundamentals.

The project brief had 2 main predefined rules that my final application had to meet, one was for how the application functions and the other was for how I architected my services.
